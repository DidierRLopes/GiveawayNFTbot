## Disclaimer

Although this is an interesting bot application you should note **Reddit rules**:

"_Votes must be cast by humans. That is, API clients proxying a human’s action one-for-one are OK, but bots deciding how to vote on content or amplifying a human’s vote are not. See the reddit rules for more details on what constitutes vote cheating._"
